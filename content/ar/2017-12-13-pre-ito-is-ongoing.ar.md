In order to prepare for ITO, we require ca. $500.000. This amount will allow to launch ITO campaign
in March 2018, where we are expecting to raise ca. $20m for the development of the platform,
cross-border scaling and business development, as well as for R&D and further implementation
of BC & PIDS technologies.

In January 2018 we are planning to conclude Pre-ITO for MDL the Token. MDL Token was issued
on the 8th of October 2017 on Waves platform in the amount of 100.000.000.

Token asset information can be found under -

In order to join the Pre-ITO sale, participants should install Waves wallet. Please proceed to
waveswallet.io

During the Pre-ITO in January 2018 we will distribute 50% of the total amount, which is
50,000,000 tokens, at an average price of $0,01. 20% of the amount will be spent on bounties and
30% will remain with the team.

Every individual from the whitelist will be able to purchase MDL token up to $20000 in ETH, BTC,
BCH, SKY, and Waves. Payments should be received up-front.

The Pre-ITO will last for three weeks and will be done manually. The soft cap of the pre-crowdsale
is $500,000 and hard cap is $600,000.

For the ITO we will issue new MDL Token on Skyledger in the amount of 1.000.000.000. The
Pre-ITO MDL Token will be exchanged to the new ITO Token in the proportion (1:1).

During the ITO in early March we are planning to distribute 40% of the total amount (400.000.000
MDL Tokens) in order to raise $20m, thus average price of the token will be about $0,05, which is
5x from the Pre-ITO sale.

Soft cap for ITO will be $10m and hard cap is $25m. Individual purchase cap TBD. The rest 60%
of the pool will be left for mining, ecosystem economy, and bounty programs. The shares of the
pool TBD.
