***What we are doing and why?***

In the ongoing blockchain mania there are so many projects that seem to be less than genuine or even fake. ICOs have become not only a tool for startups to raise funds, but also for scammers looking to make a quick buck. Is MDL Talent Hub a real project with a well thought out vision and development plan, or it is just riding the wave of cryptohype? We believe we stand on solid ground and here is why. 

**First of all, why do we need blockchain technology just to create a recruitment application?** 

We believe that the current means of booking talents are outdated logically and technologically. With tge help of blockchain technology (as well as other instruments and approaches) we are going to create a reputational model, so that all market activity can be consolidated and traced. What's more, by using the MDL Token we are going to create an economy as an ecosystem, which will allow us not only to attract more participants, but also spread sources of income. Thus commission on transactions will be decreased and hence we will overcome our possible competitors. 

***Why are we focusing specifically on the performer sourcing market?***

There are several reasons.  First of all, we want to start with a niche market and we believe that the segment we have chosen requires technological facilitation the most – there are currently no comprehensive and global search engines for performers and performing jobs. Our team has solid experience in this area and we are not only aware of existing problems, but we also can see the way to solve them. 
Secondly, we believe that the market will continue to see increasing growth in the context of the industrial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0">revolution 4.0</a> when robots and AI take more and more jobs. People are creative by nature and we want to simplify the monetization of their hobbies and skills with help of our solution. 
And the last, but not the least, we think it is fun to work with talents! Performers are outstanding and their energy is vital for human development, so we want to be as close to the source of creativity as possible!
