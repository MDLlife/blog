Since South Korea is actively promoting startup ecosystem and innovations to survive fierce technological competition in Asia, Korean government has initiated program of annual startup festivals and last week was the first successful trial of gathering entrepreneurs, tech media, and VCs under one roof of COEX complex in Seoul.

MDL Talent Hub was kindly invited to participate in the event and was lucky enough to get an excellent exposure since the problems the project is aiming to solve exist in Korea as well. The festival was an amazing opportunity to enlarge our business network and get some useful ideas for the development.

MDL team loves Korea and is aiming to enter its market in 2019.
