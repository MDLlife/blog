###   Short Event Recap

>**MDL Talent Hub** visited the China Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fair in Guangzhou last week. The main goal was to visit and meet up with new agencies, brands and investors who we could collaborate with.

>While doing so, we also had a booth at the CIEF to expose the MDL Community and grow it amongst potential partner projects and people interested in innovative projects, such as MDL Talent Hub.

>At the fair, we managed to connect with a lot of interesting people from both the talent side as well as the agency/booker/brand side.

>Besides that we met with reporters, had an interview filmed with our CEO Dimitry Doronin and had a lot of fun with existing and new MDL Fans who got the chance to win an MDL T-shirt if they could get the ball into the hoop we installed at our booth!

>To round things up, it is safe to say that it was a great event and we met some wonderful people, both on the fair aswel as after hours. We had some lovely help from 2 models who we hired to support us with sharing the information and playing the basketbal games and both of them did a wonderful job helping the MDL Booth stand out more than any of the booths around us!
