Huge news, is that now in the Settings page, you can enable Skycoin support!

Receiving via QR on main page now opens much faster.
We now added French UI, while we already had Dutch, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Japanese.

You can purchase some MDL tokens straight from the wallet with Get MDL feature.
Currently Skycoin and Ethereum are enabled to buy with.
Check the price carefully, because often good deal tokens are available at XBTS.io exchange, not in large volumes though,
where MDL has been traded for more than a year now.
Android MDL Wallet supports custom MDL urls.
Supports the brand new MDL Chess app, and other upcoming apps.

## MDL Chess App

MDL Talent Hub was the first ever blockchain project, who organized blockchain powered international
online [Chess Championship](https://mdl.wtf/en/2019-01-19-mdl-new-year-2019-chess-tournament-opens-today/). Now we want to take a step up and put friendly and rated chess games on blockchains as well.
We have started building MDL Chess app in Flutter and are welcoming those who interested to participate in development and testing.
It's now already available on Google Play in Alpha channel(you need to conctact our devs to get access), and soon will move on to the Beta stage.

## MDL[.]live relocates to MDL.cx

The platform is online and is in development. We had to move domain names, and CX seemed like a very nice destination:
Sign up at [MDL.cx](https://MDL.cx) If you know React, golang, curious about ipfs, blockchain and crypto, and what MDL Talent Hub is trying to achieve globally, write us a line. We want you in our team.

## Play DEXgames with MDL Tokens

MDL tokens are now integrated in [dexgames.net](https://dexgames.net) platform, our partners. Enjoy.

## MDL Desktop Wallet 0.27

It's almost ready and will support [Skycoin Hardware wallet](https://www.skycoin.com/skywallet/), along other cool improvements in the wallet UI.
We're finalising some details and fixing tests before we can publish it to the audience.
After the release, we recommend everybody updating as soon as possible.
