[**MDL Talent Hub**](https://www.mdl.life/) is changing the landscape of how web-shop owners, fashion designers and anyone in the fashion industry is conducting their business. In the past it used to be unreliable, expensive and risky to work with talents (In this context, models that web-shops would use to create an advertisement, promo video, event, or fashion show) or talent agencies unless you paid a hefty sum of money.

MDL is helping to reduce that cost and entry barrier by applying a reputation system and making the [talent-booking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent) industry much more accessible and safe.

[MDL Talent Hub](https://www.mdl.life/) is doing many things and we advice you to learn more about their full scope of activities in our other medium articles [HERE](https://medium.com/@dd_96182/10-ways-to-improve-the-talent-booking-industry-66c8966e422e) and [HERE](https://medium.com/@dd_96182/how-one-small-company-is-changing-the-entertainment-industry-773bda3fcb79).
