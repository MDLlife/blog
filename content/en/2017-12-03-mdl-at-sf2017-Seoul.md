Since South Korea is actively promoting the startup ecosystem and innovations to survive the fierce technological competition in Asia, the Korean government has initiated a program of annual startup festivals, and last week was the first successful trial. It was a gathering of  entrepreneurs, tech media, and VCs all under one roof of the COEX complex in Seoul.

MDL Talent Hub was kindly invited to participate in the event and was lucky enough to gain some excellent exposure since the problems the project is aiming to solve exist in Korea as well. The festival was an amazing opportunity to enlarge our business network and get some useful ideas for our further development.

The MDL team loves Korea and is aiming to enter its market in 2019!
