> 'If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.'
> - Albert Einstein

That especially applies to constantly evolving talent market that requires nonstop monitoring and analysis in order to be aware of constantly evolving issues. In addition, because solutions are not easy to develop, certain complications simply remain ignored. Thus not only identifying existing issues, but also foreseeing upcoming ones and taking preventive measures is necessary to allow one to be on the top of things.

Understanding the business processes in the talent market as well as the ability to utilize contemporary technological solutions will allow our team to become a game changer in the industry. Our tools will help to resolve existing issues and make the lives of conscientious market participants better.

Specifically, we are going to do the following:

1.	As insiders in the industry we are able to determine and develop simple instruments for both bookers and talents, such as easy-to-use booking system, appealing standardized talent profiles, time-management tools, talent catalogs for clients, and more.
2.	By providing useful tools for both talents and bookers we will consolidate existing market on one platform, so that the search for talents and jobs will be simplified.
3.	With the help of blockchain technology we will establish a permanent and immutable reputation rating system for every participant, and thus bring transparency and credibility to the market.

When developing the platform we are going to employ an iterative approach so that our tools will be constantly evolving according to the market conditions and needs. The cornerstone of this endeavor is our philosophy â€“ providing more efficiency and transparency to benefit society.
