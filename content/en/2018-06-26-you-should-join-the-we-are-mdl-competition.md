### You should join the We Are MDL Competition!
This is why.

**First** off is to show your talent to the world. Show something you love, what you have a flair for, what cheers you up and what you express your personality through.

**Second** off is to grab a chance to win MDL tokens. “What can I do with them?” — the common question that immediately pops up in the mind of most of the talents when they hear about MDL Talent Hub and our competition. Frankly, you don’t have to be a blockchain geek or crypto trader to enjoy the usage of MDL tokens and benefit from them.

## So what exactly are MDL tokens?
They are a unique in-app currency that will allow you to benefit from a lot of features within the MDL application and allow you to make in-app purchases to boost your profile, get more job offers for paid performances, and more. Don’t want to exploit your tokens in the app? Simply sell them and make a buck!

MDL tokens holder can accumulate MDL Token Hours, these are required to make transactions on the platform! The more token hours you have, the more transactions you can make. You can easily accumulate them by holding onto your tokens for at least one or more hours!

>This means that holding onto 10 MDL Tokens for one hour, accumulates you 10 token hours, holding on to 100 MDL Tokens for one hour accumulates you 100 Token hours, and so on.
