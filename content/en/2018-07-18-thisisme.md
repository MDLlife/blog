## #ThisIsMe
# We all have a story to tell.

> **B**eing an artist, a model, or a dancer is getting more and more arduous nowadays. Talents are often misused, cheated, or simply treated poorly. Moreover, there is always a strict competition in the market. This, combined with the problems of business transparency and efficiency makes the talent and talent booking market more challenging than ever.


> MDL Talent Hub was created to solve all these issues, connect talents, bookers, agencies, and brands and make a breakthrough in the talent sourcing industry.

> To facilitate relationships in the triangle of talents, bookers, and clients, we need to share the experience and obstacles that each has to go through on the path to success. That’s why we should all share our story.

> We are excited to launch our new campaign **“#ThisIsMe”** to give all talents a chance to tell their own emotional life story and share their experience of ups and downs.

## Here’s what you need to do

1. Put your words on paper (Word, Google Doc, …) (English, Russian, Chinese, any language really!) and tell us a story about a time during a gig where you did something embarrassing, you overcame a challenge, made a mistake, learned a good lesson or had the luckiest day ever. We all have some ups and downs as talents, tell us about yours. (Aim for about 100 words)

2. Include a short introduction of yourself along with your picture and add it to the word or google doc so that we can introduce you to our global MDL community.

3. Within 10 days after the beginning of the campaign submit the google or word doc here: [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/xfXCSxDMJeHBxp6ysBjN) Submission
