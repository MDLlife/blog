In the very beginning of December, the MDL Team will join Startup Festival 2017 in Seoul, South Korea. SF2017 is organized for the first time by the Korean government in order to facilitate an innovative ecosystem in the country. There will be around 60 chosen startups from Asia who have been personally invited to meet VCs and media from all around the world.  MDL is on the list!

It will be the first big event for us as a team and we are looking forward to giving a nice impression to our potential partners as well as old friends that we will meet there.

In addition, we are glad to announce that our webpage [mdl.life](http://mdl.life) has been launched now, and we have this wonderful video to explain what we are actually aiming to do.

Enjoy!
