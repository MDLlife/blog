## MDL New Year 2019 Chess tournament starting soon

So the year has started, and any day now the MDL Global Chess Tournament will be starting too!

As soon as the last 10-15 people that we are aiming for join we will begin scheduling games on lichess, so be sure to sign up and compete for big MDL prizes if you haven’t already.

Here’s how it works:

 * [Join MDL Games and Tournaments Telegram Group](https://t.me/mdlgamesandtournaments)

 * [Get MDL address from the wallet](https://github.com/MDLlife/MDL/releases)

 * Set up a (free) account on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org) if you haven’t, then input your profile name and information on [the public sign up sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4dooMruWkNZjJ8heKMxA3m9myVQ1ce4RafH5AyFD8JA-UJA/viewform).

 * Compete online with opponents from the tournament around the world (15 minutes / + 15 seconds per game), and send in the results of your games and the public link as you progress.

 * Get up to 40% of the total prize tokens for winning first place, and at least 1% for all who take part (finishing 7th place or lower).

MDL is starting the reward pool at 155,000 MDL (that’s $7750 worth) and will be adding in 1550 MDL for every person who joins the competition. If 100 people play, that looks like:
