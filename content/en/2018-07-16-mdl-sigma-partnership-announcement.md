# MDL+Sigma Partnership 
## Announcement.

> MDL Talent Hub made another push forward with their goal of uniting talents, brands and agencies. And today we are happy to announce our new partnership and welcome [Sigma](http://sigmascouting.ru/) onboard.

> Founded in 2015, within only a few years, Sigma has become one of the most prominent model scouting agencies in Russia, having formed three basic directions such as photo shooting, modeling, and promo.

> Now, Sigma can be called with no doubt as one of the leaders in the Russian model scouting market, already having more than 500 people in the team and over 50 offices across Russia and Belarus. Each branch has its own model school based on the unique teaching methods and is consisted of 13 theoretical subjects and extensive professional practice.
 
> Back to those times when Sigma was founded, it was an association of specialists with a broad experience of working in Russian biggest model agencies. It was a group of professionals who wanted to create something new and innovative in the modeling business, deploying all their skills and experience. This is also where the name comes from. Sigma is a union of knowledge and common goals. The goals that disrupt the industry and bring it to an entirely new level. MDL Talent Hub is looking forward to our fruitful cooperation in the future and explore new challenges together. Big things are coming up. Keep your eyes open!

> We are always active on Telegram. Join our group chat to know more about MDL and everything that’s going on within our community.

**And as always:**
