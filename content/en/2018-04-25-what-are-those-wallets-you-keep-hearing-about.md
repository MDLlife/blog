## What are those wallets you keep hearing about?
It's quite simple really.

>A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows users to manage digital currencies. A blockchain Wallet is provided by a blockchain company

**[SHORT VERSION]**

>A wallet is similar to the one in your pocket, but it's located on your computer. It stores digital currencies or tokens. Each company can have its own wallet. MDL Talent Hub has its own wallet which you need to receive MDL Tokens. MDL Tokens are the currency MDL Talent Hub uses for its services. It has an equivalent monetary value ex. 1000 MDL = $50

## Find out how to buy, sell, receive and send MDL in the video below.

**[FULL EXPLANATION]**

To follow up on the above |quote: MDL Talent Hub has its own currency, but instead of calling it a currency, we categorize it as a Token. It has the same functions however you can look at Tokens more in the sense of an "In game currency" but for companies!

When we take MDL Talent Hub for example, they have "MDL" (Tokens), which is the name of their Token. 1 MDL (Token) has a certain monetary value which may fluctuate determined by the market conditions at that time.

So if you own, for example, 1000 MDL Tokens, you have an equivalent value of $50 in your possession. These Tokens however, need to be stored somewhere, right? Right.

That's where wallets come in! Imagine a wallet that didn't sit in your pants' pocket, but on your computer. This is exactly what the MDL Wallet is, a wallet for storing MDL Tokens on your computer! It allows you to buy and sell (send) Tokens to other people. It also allows you to see the current value of 1 MDL Token.

## How do I use a wallet?
