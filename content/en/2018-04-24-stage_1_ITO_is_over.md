## MDL Has Nearly Reached Its Hardcap!

It was tough, but we did it.

It was a critical decision to split the ITO into three stages and hopefully our community understood and welcomed the approach.
We did this to better align our goals and increase our transparency. Showing our intentions and being clear about our long-term strategy is an important part in maintaining our relations with every MDL stakeholder.

The funds we were able to collect during the first stage will be enough to enhance our development activities as well as continuing marketing our platform to be even more presentable for our supporters and potential investors during the 2nd and the 3rd stages of the ITO. Our mid-term plans are to build an even bigger network of partners in the entertainment industry, work closely with VCs and funds, continue developing the platform, and keep everyone happy!

The second stage is in three weeks starting on the 15th of May. Get ready!
