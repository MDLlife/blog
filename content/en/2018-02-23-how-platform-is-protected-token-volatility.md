Crypto currencies are known for their high fluctuating rates – daily trading range of 30% is not an unusual thing with these financial instruments, not to mention dumps and pumps that happen time to time. How can we deliver valuable tool to the talent sourcing market with MDL Token? The main contradiction lies in the conflict of actual platform users and crypto community – the first ones want to have stable economic ecosystem and the second ones want to speculate. The compromise should be found.

The solution is to fix all the prices on the platform to something less volatile, like USD, SDR, local national currencies, or a stable basket of crypto, which will appear sooner or later, let’s say from Skyledger
 project ecosystem. This method won’t fix the price of MDL Token allowing healthy speculation without harming ecosystem economy. Thus both parties will be satisfied.  

However this won’t eliminate the risk of MDL Token depreciation so that platform users holding MDL Tokens will be still vulnerable to external speculations, however at the same time will benefit from the Token growth. 

Economic model of MDL Token Hours is still considered and will be explained later.
