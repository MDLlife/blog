It never was a secret, that MDL Talent Hub prefers DEXes for listing, and as we were trading on Waves DEX starting from the beginning of the project, now we are very happy to announce that MDL Token is now trading on yet another decentralized exchange, DEX, [XBTS.io](https://xbts.io).

XBTS is a cryptocurrency decentralized exchange based on BitShares 2.0 protocol that allows you to trade, buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitshares, US Dollars, Euro, Russian Rubles, and soon, even gold, and other cryptocurrencies. It is fast, user friendly and allows the exchange of 50+ cryptocurrencies.

Stay tuned for more new exchanges to come in the future!
