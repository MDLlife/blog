It was never a secret that MDL Talent Hub prefers decentralized exchanges--DEXs--for listing, and as we were already trading on Waves DEX starting from the beginning of the project, we are now very happy to announce that MDL Token is also trading on yet another DEX: [XBTS.io](https://xbts.io).

XBTS Decentralized Exchange is for everyone who wants to simply and securely buy and sell Bitcoins or Altcoins. Instant buy/sell of cryptocurrencies at fair price is blockchain-guaranteed. Nothing extra. 100.000 transactions per second. Confirmation time of just 3 seconds. 180+ supported countries.
XBTS DEX is a BitShares-based decentralized exchange and an entry point into the decentralized market.

You can trade any amount, at any time, from anywhere, without withdrawal limits. You can create any trading pair that you need.
With XBTS, no one must approve your account. Fast access to high liquidity orderbook for top currency pairs.
We support different types of tokens and coins. Create trading pairs against BTC, BTS, USD, DOGE, LTC, Gold, Silver, etc.

Decentralization gives XBTS robustness against failure. Transactions depend upon a public ledger, which makes privacy challenging because everyone can see every single transaction. Delegated proof-of-stake blockchain consensus is a permanent, shared digital history that cannot be independently altered or deleted.
Low Cost trading fees for takers and all market makers. XBTS DEX is decentralized across the globe. No single point of failure. Network growth through adoption rewards.
