Good news everyone! Investors who bought Waves pre-MDL Tokens can now swap them in for Mainnet MDL!

Our developers have been hard at work to make this possible and they have delivered!

Swapping is made really easy, all you need to do is download the MDL wallet HERE (Press "Get MDL") and you will be asked to download the MDL wallet.

Once there, you need to create a new wallet (Choose a name and save the seed somewhere safe) and when you select the type of currency you want to invest in exchange for MDL Tokens, you should choose "MDL.LIFE" to swap your old tokens for the new ones!


The Steps To Take:

1 Download the wallet

2 Open the wallet and add (create) a wallet and store your "Seed" somewhere safe because if something happens and you lose your wallet, you can use that seed to find your wallet back.

3 Go to "Get MDL" and choose your MDL wallet + set your preferred payment method to "MDL.Life" to swap your Waves MDL Tokens to MDL Tokens!
