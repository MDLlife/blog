The first public appearance of MDL was on the 12th of October 2017 at Slush Conference. We presented our vision and ideas to several experienced VC investors and high-tech businessmen and not only got positive feedback and encouragement, but also received some valuable advice.

Excellent ideas cannot flourish in a closed off ecosystem, so sharing thinking and knowledge is absolutely important for survival and development in the modern world. It is said that social capital is much more important than any physical asset, so we were very happy to grow up our network by acquiring new valuable connections as well as strengthen our ties with old friends.

The MDL team would like to express its deepest gratitude to the Slush crew for such smooth organization of this inspiring event and sincerely hopes to see everyone later!
