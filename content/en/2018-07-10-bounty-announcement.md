## Summer is in full glory and so is bounty season!


MDL Talent Hub is moving fast, and that means that we have a lot of materials that require some extra hands on deck. For this reason, we are announcing another bounty run!

We have all the rules and ways to participate explained [HERE](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2621659.0) where you are also welcome to ask any additional questions!

We are looking for fresh articles, reviews, videos and other content that can help put MDL Talent Hub in the spotlight or provide useful information for people who don't know about us yet. Our MDL blog is being populated as fast and we are also looking for people who can translate the articles there. In the meantime, don't forget to also check our medium blog [HERE](https://medium.com/@dd_96182).

All of this and more is right around the corner so be sure to grab that bounty and provide your help to be a part of the MDL Talent Hub community!
