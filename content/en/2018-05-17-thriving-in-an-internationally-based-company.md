## Thriving in an internationally based company — MDL Talent Hub leads the way

MDL Talent Hub is working cross-borders and for many teams that can be challenging, tiresome and sometimes destructive for the company culture.

Not for MDL Talent Hub. When Dimitri Doronin, CEO at MDL Talent Hub put together the MDL team, he did so with the right knowledge in mind.

## Well-managed teams

Nowadays, team structures are already considered as an indispensable tool for achieving a companies' strategic goals and keeping them alive by creating an influx of new ideas, approaches, know-how and products or services that tend to be born in well-managed teams.

## A teams' success

Knowledge sharing, communication and collaboration are a big part of an international teams' success. There is a lot of research being done aiming on integrating new constructs into existing theoretical frameworks and what has been discovered so far is that only certain types of knowledge sharing might be beneficial for a team, organization or even a society.

>Knowing what works and what doesn't can make or break the way an international team functions. — Dimitri Doronin

## A teams' challenges

Generally, highly geographically dispersed teams have several problems that hinders their productivity — members don’t share similar contextual knowledge, and that’s why it takes time for them to find common points; such teams require more efforts for coordination and management of resources. This generally also causes free-riding and thus hinders efficiency which is why good team management is crucial for an international team to work.

## MDL Talent Hub thrives as an internationally based company.

Dimitri Doronin, General manager and CEO of MDL Talent Hub has accumulated ample experience in team management and behavioral tendencies in international teams. Part of this is because of his PhD in Organizational Behavior: Creativity Management” — his PhD research in Org. Beh. related to quality of knowledge sharing and its effect of virtual team efficiency and part of this is because of his years of experience of working in the Talent-Booking industry, requiring him to work with lots of international teams of people who all had different ethnic background, cultural views and diverse ways of doing things.


Dimitri manages to bring over this knowledge and experience and apply it to ensure the MDL Talent Hub internal team works like a well oiled machine.
