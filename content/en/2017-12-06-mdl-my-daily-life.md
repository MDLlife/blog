For the last several decades the world's economy has been experiencing a massive shift from agriculture and production based to services and creative based, as noted by Richard Florida, the head of the Martin Prosperity Institute, Canada. Modern technologies disrupt the economy in such a way that more and more people will be left unemployed. The change is so momentous that ideas which were previously considered insane such as that of unconditional basic income are already being implemented in advanced countries. Very soon our society will face the point when routine physical and even mental human labor are not required anymore for advancement. Here comes the question – what the hell will people do?

MDL Talent Hub will probably not save the world, but certainly the platform will make it brighter. One of the fundamental features of the project is that it will create jobs and give some meaning to the participants’ lives. Wouldn't it be great if people could find a paying audience for their talents and monetize the time they spend on hobbies? MDL will make it easy!

Brave New World is already part of our reality, and people consciously or unconsciously admit it and regret having dropped their hobbies, and now push their own children to learn to be more artistic. A concept such as MDL Talent Hub is what will happen sooner or later, and we are happy to be the facilitators!
