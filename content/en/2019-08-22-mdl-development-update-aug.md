## MDL IOs Wallet is being developed 

We are super proud to announce that the new MDL IOs Wallet is being developed and its already functional. 
We are now in process of opening a new developer account on Apple store and getting all the approvals, so hang in there, this may take a little while! :)



We are going to walk you around, please feel free to grab a seat and enjoy the show! ;)


Because we have already pre-created this wallet for testing proposes, we will start showing the "enter your PIN" view:

After that, the next screen you will see is the wallet overview, please note that we have two addresses there, the "1" and "Bounty :)" :

To show you that is possible to create a new wallet address on a existing wallet, the next screen we are showing is Create a new Wallet steps.
We will then create a new wallet named: "I believe I can fly"

be sent to your selected change address.
