One of our active supporters in Ghana wants to show MDL Talent Hub again at this festival in August 2019, our team is super excited with the idea of having the budget to support this awesome activity with the help of our community! We‚Äôd like to help crowd fund him!

Here‚Äôs what he told us:


The CHALE WOTE Street Art Festival is an alternative platform that brings art, poets, models, actors, filmmakers, musicians, designers, dancers, and performers out onto the streets. The community-based festival takes place in James Town - one of Accra‚Äôs most historic communities - and targets exchanges between Ghana-based and international artists on the continent to create and appreciate art together.

Over the last nine years, CHALE WOTE has transformed the city of Accra into the most active cultural   and entertainment hub in West Africa. The festival has inspired new possibilities in public space design through community-supported cultural production.

Therefore looking at the core values and reading üìñ the white paper of MDL closely, I see a great need to partner the organizers of this year's edition of the Chale Wote festival to intensively market, promote, and sign up for the up-and-coming creative talent who will be represented at this event.
